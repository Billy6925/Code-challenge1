# Code-challenge1
##Description
This code challenge includes three challenges that are hereby explained:
1. Student Grade Generator.
Involves writing a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
2. Speed Detector.
Involves writing a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
3. Net Salary Calculator.
Involves writing a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Requires you to calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
